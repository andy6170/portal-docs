# What is Battlefield Portal?

EA is officially referring Portal as a Game Mode of Battlefield 2042, but it's actually a lot more than this.

It's a utility to create and host your own Battlefield servers and mod them with Low-Code.
With Portal you have the possibility to play old eras of the Battlefield Games as well next to the current 2042 era.
