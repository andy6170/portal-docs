Geekdocs and located in the hugo folder The docs are also split into two parts:\nThe docs that are hand-written and located in the docs folder\nThe docs that are generated using the portal_blocks_documentation module.\nThe process to generate new docs for portal blocks is pretty much automated\nThe official documentation for each block is retrieved and saved to the docs/portal_blocks/\u0026lt;block_name\u0026gt;/docs/official.md folder\nAny changes to this file will be overwritten when the docs are regenerated The docs/portal_blocks/\u0026lt;block_name\u0026gt;/docs/extra.md file is where you can add extra information about the block\nThis file will not be overwritten when the docs are regenerated Contributing to the docs To contribute to the docs to need to:\nSetup hugo on your machine, you can follow the official guide Clone this repo (requires git) git clone https://github.com/battlefield-portal-community/portal-docs Change directory to the hugo folder and run hugo server -D Now depending on the type of doc you want to contribute to: If you want to contribute to the Hand written Docs If You want to add a new tutorial/guide run, hugo new content [guide|tutorial]/\u0026lt;name_of_tutorial_or_guide\u0026gt; then you should be able to find the file in docs/[guides|tutorials]/\u0026lt;name_of_tutorial_or_guide\u0026gt;/_index.md Portal Blocks Documentation If you wish to add extra information to the portal blocks documentation In docs/portal_blocks/ Find the block which you want to add information to. In that folder You will see two things. index.md which is the root of the block documentation A folder called docs which contains the documentation for the block In the Docs folder find/create a file called extra.md and add the extra information there. All the new information will be added to the bottom of the block documentation page.
